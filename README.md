The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that reproduces the analytical and Monte Carlo simulations of Double Generalized Gamma distribution.

# Content of Code Package
This package contains 3 files:

1- "DoubleGeneralizedGammaCDF.m" returns the analytical expression of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Double Generalized Gamma distribution.

2- "Delta.m" returns a function to construct the input vectors of Meijer G-function. 

2- "main.m" validates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) by comparing the analytical and Monte Carlo simulations.

See each file for further documentation.
